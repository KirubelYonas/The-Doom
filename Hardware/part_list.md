## Notes

- All hardware should be tested and used **only** in environments you **own** or have **explicit permission** to access.
- You can swap Orange Pi with Raspberry Pi 4 if available, but it usually costs more.
- Make sure to buy from trusted sellers to avoid low-quality clones (especially SDRs and ESP boards).
